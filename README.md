Environment Setup:
In our testing, we used Selenium within the programming environment of Visual Studio Code (VS Code), scripting our code using Python. To provide a thorough insight into our testing setup, here’s the steps that show how our testing environment was prepared:

1. Acquire Necessary Software:
Download and install Visual Studio Code
Obtain Python
2.Configure Visual Studio Code:
Install Python extension for Visual Studio Code
Also set the python installation path in our system
3.Selenium Installation for testing:
Create a virtual environment for our project.
While within the activated virtual environment, install Selenium using the command:
“pip install selenium”
4.WebDriver Download and Configuration:
Download Chrome Driver and put the chromedriver.exe file in a folder.
Add that folder's path to our system.
5. Write python script:
Finally, write our selenium test script for different test cases in python script within Visual Studio Code
6. Run the Script:
Run our automated test cases.

Test Case Design Strategy:
Black box testing: We have focused on system’s functional requirements and specification without any knowledge about the code or system structure. We did:

Boundary Value Analysis

Equivalence Partitioning
•
Decision Table Testing

Use Case Testing
Experienced testing: We did:

Error Guessing using our skill, intuition, and experience to anticipate potential errors.
